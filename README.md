# Construction-Delay

Construction Delay Project

Predicting engineering project delays involves several factors like project complexity, resources, team productivity, and external influences. To make a prediction model, we can use machine learning techniques. Here's a step-by-step outline for creating such a predictive model using Python:

Steps followed in Predicting Project Delays:
Data Collection: You’ll need historical data from previous engineering projects to train your model. Some useful features could be:
 • Project size (in terms of hours or budget)
 • Number of team members
 • Type of project (e.g., software, construction, etc.)
 • Historical delays (yes/no, or amount of time delayed)
 • Resource allocation
 • External factors (e.g., weather for construction, or tech issues for software)
  
Data Preprocessing: The data need not much cleaning and transformation but operations such as removing missing or irrelevant data, handling categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding), normalizing numerical data if required, and splitting the data into training and testing sets can be carried out.

Feature Engineering: Based on the data, you may need to create new features that could help with prediction:

 • Duration (how long the project took vs. estimated).
 • Dependency on external factors.
 • Team experience (average years of team members).

Model Selection: For predicting project delays, we can make use of:
Logistic Regression if predicting a binary outcome (delay/no delay).
Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machines for non-linear relationships.
Linear Regression or Support Vector Machines if predicting the amount of delay in hours/days.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained the model on the training data. Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy (for binary prediction), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.

Model Deployment: After training the model, next is deploying it to predict delays for new projects by feeding in project parameters.


Explanation of Each Step:

Data Loading:
We assume you have a CSV file (engineering_projects.csv) containing the relevant historical project data.

Data Preprocessing:
The dropna() method removes rows with missing values. You can choose to fill missing values using imputation methods instead.

We engineer two new features:
time_variance: The difference between the actual and estimated duration. A larger variance suggests the project took longer than expected.

resource_efficiency: This gives a sense of how well resources were utilized relative to the expected time. A value greater than 1 means the project took longer than planned considering the resource allocation.

Feature Selection:
We select the relevant features for prediction, including the new ones (time_variance and resource_efficiency), and the target variable delay.

Splitting the Data:
We split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

Feature Scaling:
Standard scaling is used to normalize features so that they contribute equally to the model. This is important for models like logistic regression.

Model Building:
We use Logistic Regression as a starting point for predicting binary delays (1 or 0). You can try other models like Decision Trees or Random Forests if necessary.

Prediction:
We use the test set to predict the delays and compare the model's predictions with the actual values.

Model Evaluation:
Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.


Need for model improvement
After evaluating, we found that the results we not that satisfying and the model can be improved by:
Tuning hyperparameters (e.g., using GridSearchCV), trying more complex models like Random Forests, XGBoost, or Gradient Boosting, and Collecting more data or adding additional features (e.g., project complexity, team experience, etc.).

Time Series Models: If the delays follow a time-based trend (i.e., delays tend to accumulate over time), you could apply time series models like ARIMA or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
